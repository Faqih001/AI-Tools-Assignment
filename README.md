# AI Tools Assignment: Mastering the AI Toolkit 🛠️🧠

## Team Information
- **Team Name**: Group 67 AI Software Engineers
- **Team Members**: 
  - Fakii Mohammed
  - Andrew Ogembo
  - Chiboniso Nyoni
  - Peterson Kagiri

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates proficiency in AI tools and frameworks through theoretical understanding, practical implementation, and ethical analysis.

## Assignment Structure

### Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (40%)
- Short answer questions about TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jupyter, and spaCy
- Comparative analysis of Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

### Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)
- **Task 1**: Classical ML with Scikit-learn (Iris Dataset)
- **Task 2**: Deep Learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch (MNIST)
- **Task 3**: NLP with spaCy (Amazon Reviews)

### Part 3: Ethics & Optimization (10%)
- Bias identification and mitigation strategies
- Code debugging challenge

### Bonus Task
- Model deployment using Streamlit/Flask
