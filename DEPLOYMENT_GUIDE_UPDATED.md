### 4. .streamlit/config.toml
Streamlit configuration for cloud deployment:
```toml
[server]
headless = true
port = 8501
enableCORS = false

[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Repository

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy AI Tools Assignment to Streamlit Cloud"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create New App:**
   - Click "New app"
   - Choose "From existing repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Set main file path: `streamlit_app/app.py`
   - Click "Deploy!"

### Step 3: Configure Environment (Optional)

If you need environment variables:
1. Click "Settings" → "Secrets"
2. Add any required secrets in TOML format

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

1. **Check deployment logs** for any issues
2. **Wait for dependencies to install** (this may take 5-10 minutes)
3. **Verify model downloads** complete successfully

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. SSL Certificate Errors
**Problem:** NLTK downloads fail with SSL certificate errors
**Solution:** The app now includes SSL context handling that creates an unverified HTTPS context for downloads.

#### 2. spaCy Model Not Found
**Problem:** "spaCy English model not found" warning
**Solution:** The setup.py script automatically downloads the model. If it fails, the app uses fallback NLP features.

#### 3. Import Errors
**Problem:** Missing dependencies cause import errors
**Solution:** All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt and have fallback handling.

#### 4. Memory Issues
**Problem:** App runs out of memory during model loading
**Solution:** Streamlit Cloud provides sufficient memory for the models used.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check deployment logs:**
   - Look for red error messages
   - Verify all dependencies install correctly
   - Check for successful model downloads

2. **Test locally first:**
   ```bash
   cd streamlit_app
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python setup.py
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Verify file paths:**
   - Ensure all imports use relative paths
   - Check that files are in correct directories
