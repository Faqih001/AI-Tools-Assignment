# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (40%)

## 1. Short Answer Questions

### Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

**Answer:**

**Primary Differences:**

1. **Execution Model:**
   - **TensorFlow**: Uses static computational graphs (define-then-run). TensorFlow 2.x introduced eager execution for dynamic graphs.
   - **PyTorch**: Uses dynamic computational graphs (define-by-run), allowing for more intuitive debugging and flexible model architectures.

2. **Learning Curve:**
   - **TensorFlow**: Steeper learning curve, more verbose syntax, but powerful for production deployment.
   - **PyTorch**: More Pythonic, intuitive syntax, easier to learn and debug.

3. **Deployment:**
   - **TensorFlow**: Excellent production tools (TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Lite for mobile, TensorFlow.js for web).
   - **PyTorch**: Growing deployment ecosystem, TorchScript for production, but traditionally weaker than TensorFlow.

4. **Community and Ecosystem:**
   - **TensorFlow**: Backed by Google, strong industry adoption, comprehensive ecosystem.
   - **PyTorch**: Backed by Meta, popular in research community, growing industry adoption.

**When to Choose:**

**Choose TensorFlow when:**
- Building production-ready applications at scale
- Need robust deployment tools (mobile, web, embedded)
- Working in an enterprise environment
- Require comprehensive MLOps tools
- Building traditional ML models alongside deep learning

**Choose PyTorch when:**
- Conducting research or prototyping
- Need flexibility in model architecture
- Prefer intuitive, Pythonic code
- Working on computer vision or NLP research
- Need dynamic computational graphs

### Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

**Answer:**

**Use Case 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**

Jupyter Notebooks excel at interactive data analysis and exploration:
- **Iterative Analysis**: Data scientists can load datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns step by step.
- **Documentation**: Combine code, visualizations, and markdown explanations in a single document, making the analysis process transparent and reproducible.
- **Quick Prototyping**: Test different preprocessing techniques, feature engineering approaches, and data transformations interactively.

*Example*: Analyzing customer behavior data by loading CSV files, creating visualizations of purchase patterns, identifying outliers, and documenting insights with explanatory text.

**Use Case 2: Model Development and Experimentation**

Jupyter Notebooks provide an ideal environment for machine learning experimentation:
- **Iterative Model Building**: Train different models, compare performance metrics, and tune hyperparameters in separate cells.
- **Visualization of Results**: Display training curves, confusion matrices, and model predictions inline with the code.
- **Collaborative Research**: Share notebooks with team members to demonstrate methodologies, results, and findings.

*Example*: Developing a sentiment analysis model by experimenting with different architectures (LSTM, BERT), comparing accuracy scores, visualizing training progress, and documenting the best-performing approach.

### Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

**Answer:**

**spaCy Enhancements over Basic String Operations:**

1. **Linguistic Intelligence:**
   - **Basic String Operations**: Limited to pattern matching, splitting, and basic text manipulation without understanding language structure.
   - **spaCy**: Provides linguistic analysis including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition.

2. **Pre-trained Models:**
   - **Basic String Operations**: No built-in language understanding; requires manual rule creation.
   - **spaCy**: Comes with pre-trained statistical models that understand grammar, syntax, and semantics across multiple languages.

3. **Advanced NLP Features:**
   - **Basic String Operations**: Can only perform surface-level text processing (finding substrings, replacing text).
   - **spaCy**: Offers advanced features like:
     - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
     - Dependency parsing
     - Word vectors and similarity
     - Sentence segmentation
     - Lemmatization and stemming

4. **Performance and Efficiency:**
   - **Basic String Operations**: Fast for simple operations but inefficient for complex NLP tasks.
   - **spaCy**: Optimized for speed with Cython implementation, can process millions of tokens efficiently.

**Example Comparison:**

```python
# Basic String Operations
text = "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in 1976."
# Limited to: text.split(), text.replace(), text.find()

# spaCy
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(text)
# Can extract: entities (Apple Inc., Steve Jobs, 1976), 
# relationships, part-of-speech tags, and semantic meaning
```
